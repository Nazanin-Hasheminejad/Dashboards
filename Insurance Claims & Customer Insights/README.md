## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This **Power BI dashboard** was developed as a self-assigned project using the **Healthcare Insurance dataset** from **Kaggle**. The dashboard provides an **interactive and data-driven analysis** of:
- **Key influencers of high claim amounts** â€“ Identifying factors that significantly impact insurance claims.
- **Customer segmentation** â€“ Understanding **which customer groups** are more likely to have high claims.
- **Demographic insights** â€“ Analyzing the characteristics of **insurance customers** to help improve business strategies.

Although this dataset focuses on **healthcare insurance**, the same analytical approach can be applied to **any insurance dataset** to gain similar insights.
