# PhoneNow Customer Retention Dashboard - Power BI Report  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This Power BI Customer Retention Dashboard was developed as part of the PwC Power BI Certification Course on Forage. It provides an interactive and data-driven analysis of customer churn for PhoneNow, enabling the Retention Manager to identify at-risk customers and implement proactive retention strategies.



**Business Problem**  
- **Customer retention is critical** in the telecom industry as acquiring new customers is costly.  
- The **Retention Department** currently operates **reactively**, reaching out to customers only after contract termination.  
- A **proactive approach** is needed to **predict churn risk** before customers leave.  
- Traditional **Excel-based analysis** has proven insufficient, requiring a **visual, data-driven** approach for **management insights**.

## 📌 **Key Features & Functionalities**  

### **1. Interactive Filters for Customer Segmentation**  
- Users can **filter** by **Service Type, Contract Type, Family & Dependents, and Subscription Add-ons** *(Movies, TV, Security, Backup, etc.)*.  
- These filters help **identify high-risk customer segments** and determine **which services have a higher churn rate**, enabling **targeted retention efforts**.  

### **2. Key Influencers for Churn Prediction**  
- Utilizes **AI-powered insights** via Power BI’s **Key Influencers** visualization.  
- Identifies **top factors impacting churn**, including:  
  - **Contract Type** – Customers on **long-term contracts** are less likely to churn.  
  - **Total Charges** – Customers with **higher total charges** tend to have a **lower churn risk**.  
- Helps the **Retention Team prioritize strategies** based on data-driven churn indicators.  

### **3. Impact of Customer Issues on Churn**  
- **Bar Chart** analyzing how **support tickets (administrative & technical) correlate with churn rates**.  
- Demonstrates that **customers experiencing frequent service issues** are at a **higher risk of leaving**.  
- Provides **actionable insights for improving customer support** and **reducing churn rates**. 

### **4. Churn Analysis by Tenure**  
- **Line Chart** visualizing the **churn rate across customer tenure periods**.  
- Identifies **critical risk periods** where customers are most likely to leave.  
- Confirms that **new customers tend to have higher retention rates**.  

### **5. Customer Status Breakdown**  
- **Donut Chart** displaying the proportion of **Active vs. Churned Customers**.  
- Provides a **quick snapshot of the churn percentage**, enabling **management to track retention performance** effectively.
