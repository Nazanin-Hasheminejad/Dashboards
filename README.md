# Employee Diversity, Performance & Turnover Insights - Power BI Dashboard  

## üìå Project Overview  
This **Power BI dashboard** was developed as part of the **PwC Power BI Certification Course** on **Forage**. 

This **Power BI Dashboard** was developed to support **Human Resources** in analyzing **diversity, performance, and employee turnover** within a telecom company. The HR team has been striving to **improve gender balance at the executive level** but has faced challenges in making measurable progress.  

To address this, the dashboard provides **interactive insights** into workforce **diversity, promotions, and turnover rates**, helping HR leaders make **data-driven decisions** to foster an inclusive workplace.  

**Business Problem**  
- **Diversity and Inclusion** are business imperatives, not just ‚Äúnice-to-haves.‚Äù  
- HR needs **clear KPIs** to measure **gender balance, promotions, and employee turnover**.  
- Despite efforts, **gender balance at the executive level remains stagnant**.  
- The company seeks **data-driven insights** to pinpoint **disparities in promotions and turnover**.

## üìå **Key Features & Functionalities**  

### **1. Interactive Filters for Workforce Analysis**  
- Filters include **Nationality, Gender, Department, and Job Level**.  
- Enables **dynamic analysis** of **diversity and performance across multiple dimensions**.  

### **2. Diversity & Performance Level Gauges**  
- **Gauge 1:** Shows the **percentage of women** in the selected category.  
- **Gauge 2:** Displays the **total performance score** for the selected workforce segment.  

### **3. Employee Performance & Promotion Table**  
- Provides a breakdown of **male vs. female employees**, including:  
  - **Number of Employees**  
  - **Average Performance Rating**  
  - **Number of Promotions**  
  - **Number of Leavers**  
- Key Insights:  
  - Despite similar **average performance ratings**, **men receive significantly more promotions**.  
  - However, the **number of leavers is nearly identical** for both genders, indicating **higher loyalty among female employees despite fewer promotions**.  

### **4. Dynamic Bar Charts for Performance & Turnover**  
- **Left Bar Chart:** Displays **average performance** based on a **selected variable** *(e.g., job level, nationality, promotions, age group, etc.)*.  
- **Right Bar Chart:** Shows **number of leavers** based on the same variable.  
- Using these bar charts, users can **analyze 14 different relationships** between variables, providing deep insights into workforce trends.
